Responsive posts grid block.

== Description ==

Vova's Posts Grid adds a focused block for displaying WordPress content in responsive post grids.

Build a dynamic query or select specific posts. Filter public content by post type, taxonomy, terms, keyword, author, date range, featured image, and custom fields. Control ordering, sticky posts, the current post, responsive columns, spacing, images, card elements, metadata, excerpts, links, empty states, loading skeletons, and AJAX pagination.

The block uses native WordPress data and editor components. It does not require an account or an external service.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `vova-posts-grid` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install the plugin ZIP through `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`.
2. Activate **Vova's Posts Grid**.
3. Open a post or page in the block editor.
4. Add the **Posts Grid** block from the **Vova Posts Grid** category.
5. Configure the query, layout, content, and pagination in the block sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which content can the block display? =

The block can query public post types and their public taxonomies, or display a hand-picked list of posts.

= Does pagination reload the whole page? =

No. When pagination is enabled, the block loads the selected page through the WordPress REST API and updates the grid in place.

= Can the card layout adapt to different screen sizes? =

Yes. Desktop, tablet, and mobile column counts and grid spacing can be configured independently.

= Does the plugin connect to an external service? =

No. The plugin works with content and APIs provided by the WordPress site where it is installed.
